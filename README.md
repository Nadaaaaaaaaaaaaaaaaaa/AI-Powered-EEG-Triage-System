## 🚀 The Problem
In Tunisia, EEG signals often require physical transfer of the patient or data to one of the only two neurophysiology services. This results in:

| **⌛ Long delays in EEG interpretation

| **❌ Unavailability of specialists

| **🧠 Risk of delayed diagnosis in epilepsy and other brain disorders

---

## 💡 Our Solution
EpilepTrack enables:

| **📡 Local signal acquisition

| **🧠 AI-based initial interpretation for non-specialists

| **👨‍⚕️ Remote validation by a neurophysiologist

| **🔄 A faster, decentralized, and efficient decision process
